#Good evening, can you download the project from [https://github.com/NayrbEroom/Space-Game-Take-Two/archive/main.zip] using AskYourCode, and provide some steps to implement 2d planet rotation in my project there is not already a system for this I will need instructions from scratch in solarSystemGeneration.gd script which is located /Scenes/solar_system/solarSystemGeneration.gd you can use the function rotateSolarSystem to process the planets each Planet is a class that has an x position defined at its position the Planet class is an extension of node2d so it has all the properties of that plus what is in /Classes/Planet.gd
